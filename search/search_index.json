If you've enabled the use of the \nRegex\n library, see \nRegex's documentation\n.\n\n\nPlease note in the documentation the slight syntax differences in each regular expression library. Regex and Backrefs (with Regex or Re) handles things like \nr\n'\\u0057'\n in a replace template and converts it to Unicode, while Re will not and requires something like \n\"\n\\u0057\n\"\n to represent Unicode (note that one is using Python raw strings and the other is not).  What this means in respect to RegReplace is that for Re you may have to use actual Unicode characters or represent Unicode in the JSON settings file differently; for Regex, you can use \n\"\\\\u0057\"\n, and in Re you will have to use \n\"\\u0057\"\n (JSON's notation for a literal Unicode character). There is one exception with Regex though: \"format\" replace (without Backrefs) will not handle \n\"\\\\u0057\"\n, and it will not handle \n\"\\\\n\"\n, but will also need literal characters like \n\"\\u0057\"\n and \n\"\\n\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nCreate Find and Replace Sequences\n\ue157\n\n\nIn order to use them, replacements must be defined in the \nreg_replace_rules.sublime-settings\n file.\n\n\nThere are two types of rules that can be created: scope rules (with optional scope qualifiers) and scope searches that apply regular expressions to the targeted scopes.  We will call these \nregex\n and \nscope regex\n rules respectively.\n\n\nRegex\n rules use regular expressions to find regions, and then you can use scopes to qualify the regions before applying the replacements.  These rules can use the following options:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n    ###### Regex with optional scope qualifiers. ######\n\n\n    - find (required)\n\n\n    - replace\n\n\n    - literal\n\n\n    - literal_ignorecase\n\n\n    - greedy\n\n\n    - scope_filter\n\n\n    - format_replace\n\n\n    - selection_inputs\n\n\n    - plugin\n\n\n    - args\n\n\n    */\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"html5_remove_deprecated_type_attr\"\n:\n \n{\n\n                \n\"find\"\n:\n \n\"(?i)(<(style|script)[^>]*)\\\\stype=(\\\"|')text/(css|javascript)(\\\"|')([^>]*>)\"\n,\n\n                \n\"replace\"\n:\n \n\"\\\\1\\\\6\"\n,\n\n                \n\"greedy\"\n:\n \ntrue\n\n            \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second kind of rule is the \nscope regex\n which allows you to search for a scope type and then apply regular expression to the regions to filter the matches and make replacements.\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n    ###### Scope search with regular expression applied to scope region. ######\n\n\n    - scope (required)\n\n\n    - find\n\n\n    - replace\n\n\n    - literal\n\n\n    - literal_ignorecase\n\n\n    - greedy\n\n\n    - greedy_scope\n\n\n    - format_replace\n\n\n    - multi_pass\n\n\n    - selection_inputs\n\n\n    - plugin\n\n\n    - args\n\n\n    */\n\n\n    \n{\n\n            \n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n{\n\n                \n\"remove_comments\"\n:\n \n{\n\n                    \n\"scope\"\n:\n \n\"comment\"\n,\n\n                    \n\"find\"\n \n:\n \n\"(([^\\\\n\\\\r]*)(\\\\r\\\\n|\\\\n))*([^\\\\n\\\\r]+)\"\n,\n\n                    \n\"replace\"\n:\n \n\"\"\n,\n\n                    \n\"greedy\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n                    \n\"greedy_scope\"\n:\n \ntrue\n\n                \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nA description of all the options is found below:\n\n\n    name:               (str): Rule name.

One way is to create a command in the command palette by editing/creating a \nDefault.sublime-commands\n in your \nUser\n folder and then adding your command(s).\n\n\nBasic replacement command:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"remove_trailing_spaces\"\n]}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nChained replacements in one command:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Remove HTML Comments and Trailing Spaces\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"remove_html_comments\"\n,\n \n\"remove_trailing_spaces\"\n]}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also bind a replacement command to a keyboard shortcut:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"keys\"\n:\n \n[\n\"ctrl+shift+t\"\n],\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"remove_trailing_spaces\"\n]}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSelection Inputs\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\nExperimental\n\n\nThis feature is experimental and is subject to change.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nselection_inputs\n is set to \nTrue\n, selections will be inserted into your pattern via format string logic.\n\n\nSo to specify two implicit variables, the following format string logic can be used: \nr'Some value {} some [\\w]+ {}'\n.  In this example, the first two selections will be inserted in \n{}\n: \nr'Some value selection0 some [\\w]+ selection1'\n.\n\n\nTo control which selection goes where, you can explicitly set the index: \nr'Some value {1} some [\\w]+ {0}'\n \u2192. \nr'Some value selection1 some [\\w]+ selection0'\n. Or alternatively: \nr'Some value {sel[1]} some [\\w]+ {sel[0]}'\n (\nsel\n is the selection list).\n\n\nBy default, the selection is just inserted into the pattern raw.  This is fine for literal searches, but for regex this is bad if your selection is something like: \nsomething(else)\n.  This example would be interpreted as adding a group containing \nelse\n. So if this is not intended, the text would need to be escaped. So a new conversion type has been added to the format template: \n!e\n.  This new conversion type will insert the selection into the pattern after first escaping it.  So you could use it like so: \nr'Some value {1!e} some [\\w]+ {0!e}'\n, and the selection inputs would be escaped.\n\n\nFor the sake of avoiding bad situations, RegReplace will limit the length of selections to the arbitrary value of 256, but you can configure this with the global setting \nselection_input_max_size\n in \nreg_replace.sublime-settings\n. Also, the number of allowed inputs will be limited to 10, but this can be tweaked via the setting \nselection_input_max_count\n.\n\n\n    \n// Limit size of selections for inputs.\n\n    \n\"selection_input_max_size\"\n:\n \n256\n,\n\n\n    \n// Limit number of selections for inputs.\n\n    \n\"selection_input_max_count\"\n:\n \n10\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should go without saying, but this is incompatible if you have the global option \nselection_only\n set which will search in selection content.  Though you can ignore it per command via the command parameter \nno_selection\n.  So if you are constructing a chain that uses selection inputs, you can temporarily disable it with \nno_selection\n.\n\n\nA Better Way to Create Regex Rules\n\ue157\n\n\nA new feature was recently added that allows editing regular expression rules in a panel with Python syntax highlighting, providing a friendlier editing experience.  Users can even split their regular expressions on multiple lines and add comments which will be preserved the next time the rule is viewed.\n\n\nWhile in the edit panel, you can press \nCtrl\n\uff0b\nS\n on Windows/Linux (or \nCmd\n\uff0b\nS\n on OSX) and the rule will be saved back to the settings file.  On saving, the regex is compiled to test if it's valid; if the test fails, a warning message is displayed and the saving operation is canceled.\n\n\nTo edit, insert, or delete rules, you can use the following command palette commands:\n\n\n\n\nRegReplace: Edit Regular Expression Rule\n\n\nRegReplace: Create New Regular Expression Rule\n\n\nRegReplace: Delete Regular Expression Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also test the regular expression from the edit panel.  At the bottom of the panel, you should see the \ntest\n variable which will allow you to configure a sequence to run from the panel.  Once configured, you can press \nCtrl\n\uff0b\nF\n on Windows/Linux (or \nCmd\n\uff0b\nF\n on OSX) to execute it.  Keep in mind that you can run the current rule sequenced together with others in the test configuration to test how it plays with other rules.  \ntest\n is not saved with the other settings, but is only good for the current session.\n\n\n# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n# test: Here you can setup a test command.  This is not saved and is just used for this session.\n\n\n#     - replacements ([str]): A list of regex rules to sequence together.\n\n\n#     - find_only (bool): Highlight current find results and prompt for action.\n\n\n#     - action (str): Apply the given action (fold|unfold|mark|unmark|select).\n\n\n#       This overrides the default replace action.\n\n\n#     - options (dict): optional parameters for actions (see documentation for more info).\n\n\n#         - key (str): Unique name for highlighted region.\n\n\n#         - scope (str - default=\"invalid\"): Scope name to use as the color.\n\n\n#         - style (str - default=\"outline\"): Highlight style (solid|underline|outline).\n\n\n#     - multi_pass (bool): Repeatedly sweep with sequence to find all instances.\n\n\n#     - no_selection (bool): Overrides the \"selection_only\" setting and forces no selections.\n\n\n#     - regex_full_file_with_selections (bool): Apply regex search to full file then apply\n\n\n#       action to results under selections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on how the test command was configured, it may cause the panel to close, or you might accidentally close it by pressing \nEsc\n or running some other command.  When closed, the currently opened rule is not lost and can be brought back by running the command palette command \nRegReplace: Show Edit Panel\n (the command will only work if the panel has been opened at least once).  You can also use the panel icon in the bottom left hand corner of the Sublime Text window (only on later versions of Sublime Text 3).\n\n\nView Without Replacing\n\ue157\n\n\nIf you would like to simply view what the sequence would find, without carrying out any replacements, (aka \"dry run\") you can construct a command to highlight targets without replacing them (each pass could affect the end result, but this just shows all passes without predicting the replacements).\n\n\nJust add the \n\"find_only\"\n argument and set it to \ntrue\n.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"remove_trailing_spaces\"\n],\n \n\"find_only\"\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nA prompt will appear allowing you to replace the highlighted regions.  Regions will be cleared on cancel.\n\n\nIf for any reason the highlights do not get cleared, you can simply run the \"RegReplace: Clear Highlights\" command from the command palette.\n\n\nHighlight color and style can be changed in the settings file.\n\n\nOverride Actions\n\ue157\n\n\nIf instead of replacing you would like to do something else, you can override the action. Actions are defined in commands by setting the \naction\n parameter.  Some actions may require additional parameters be set in the \noptions\n parameter.  See examples below.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Fold HTML Comments\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"remove_html_comments\"\n],\n \n\"action\"\n:\n \n\"fold\"\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Unfold HTML Comments\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"remove_html_comments\"\n],\n \n\"action\"\n:\n \n\"unfold\"\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Mark Example\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"example\"\n],\n\n            \n\"action\"\n:\n \n\"mark\"\n,\n\n            \n\"options\"\n:\n \n{\n\"key\"\n:\n \n\"name\"\n,\n \n\"scope\"\n:\n \n\"invalid\"\n,\n \n\"style\"\n:\n \n\"underline\"\n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Unmark Example\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"action\"\n:\n \n\"unmark\"\n,\n\n            \n\"options\"\n:\n \n{\n\"key\"\n:\n \n\"name\"\n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported override actions\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\nfold\n\n\nunfold\n\n\nmark\n\n\nunmark\n\n\nselect\n\n\n\n\nFold Override\n\ue157\n\n\n\"action\"\n:\n \n\"fold\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis action folds the given find target.

In such cases, you can use the multi-pass option.  This option will cause the repeated execution of the entire sequence until all instances are found and replaced.  To protect against a poorly constructed multi-pass regular expression looping forever, there is a default max sweep threshold that will cause the sequence to kick out when reached.  This threshold can be tweaked in the settings file.\n\n\nMulti-pass is used in replaces and cannot be paired with override actions (it will be ignored), but it can be paired with \nfind_only\n as \nfind_only\n allows you to initiate a replace.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"example\"\n],\n \n\"multi_pass\"\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace Only Within Selection(s)\n\ue157\n\n\nSometimes you only want to search inside selections.  This can be done by enabling the \nselection_only\n setting in the settings file.  By enabling this setting, regular expression targets will be limited to the current selection if \nand only if\n a selection exists.  Auto replace/highlight on save events ignore this setting.  If you want a given command to ignore this setting, just set the \nno_selection\n argument to \ntrue\n.  Highlight style will be forced to underline selections if \nfind_only\n is set, to ensure they will show up.\n\n\n    \n// Ignore \"selection_only\" setting\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Reg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"example\"\n],\n \n\"multi_pass\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n \n\"no_selection\"\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Regular Expressions on Entire File Buffer When Using Selections\n\ue157\n\n\nWhen \nselection_only\n is enabled, a regular expression chain might perform better by applying the regular expression on the entire file buffer and then pick the matches under the selections \u2014 as opposed to the default behavior of applying the regular expression directly to the selection buffer.  This can be achieved via the \nregex_full_file_with_selections\n option:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Remove: All Comments\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n\"remove_comments\"\n,\n \n\"remove_trailing_spaces\"\n,\n\n                \n\"remove_excessive_newlines\"\n,\n \n\"ensure_newline_at_file_end\"\n\n            \n],\n\n            \n\"find_only\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n            \n\"regex_full_file_with_selections\"\n:\n \ntrue\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Regular Expressions Right Before File Save Event\n\ue157\n\n\nIf you want a sequence to be automatically applied before a file saves, you can define \"on save\" sequences in the \nreg_replace.sublime-settings\n file.  Each \"on save\" sequence will be applied to the files matched by the file patterns or file regular expressions you specify.  You must also set \non_save\n to \ntrue\n.  If you want the sequence to just highlight, fold, or unfold by regular expression, add the \n\"action\": \"mark\"\n key/value pair (supported values: \nmark\n|\nfold\n|\nunfold\n). Both types can be used at the same time. Actions are performed after replacements.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n    \n// If on_save is true, RegReplace will search through the file patterns listed below right before a file is saved,\n\n    \n// If the file name matches a file pattern, the sequence will be applied before the file is saved.\n\n    \n// RegReplace will apply all sequences that apply to a given file in the order they appear below.\n\n    \n\"on_save\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n    \n// Highlight visual settings\n\n    \n\"on_save_highlight_scope\"\n:\n \n\"invalid\"\n,\n\n    \n\"on_save_highlight_style\"\n:\n \n\"outline\"\n,\n\n\n    \n\"on_save_sequences\"\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n// An example on_save event that removes dangling commas from json files\n\n        \n// - file_regex: an array of regex strings that must match the file for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - case: regex case sensitivity (true|false) false is default (this setting is optional)\n\n        \n//   See https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/re.html for more information on Python's re.\n\n        \n// - file_pattern: an array of file patterns that must match for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - sequence: an array of replacement definitions to be applied on saving the file\n\n        \n// - multi_pass: perform multiple passes on file to catch all regex instances\n\n        \n{\n\n            \n\"file_regex\"\n:\n \n[\n\"(?i).*\\\\.sublime-(settings|commands|menu|keymap|mousemap|theme|build|project|completions|commands)\"\n],\n\n            \n\"file_pattern\"\n:\n \n[\n\"*.json\"\n],\n\n            \n\"sequence\"\n:\n \n[\n\"remove_json_dangling_commas\"\n]\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n// An example on_save_sequence that targets all files and highlights trailing spaces\n\n        \n// - file_pattern: an array of file patterns that must match for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - sequence: an array of replacement definitions to be applied on saving the file\n\n        \n// - action: (mark|fold|unfold) instead of replace\n\n        \n{\n\n            \n\"file_pattern\"\n:\n \n[\n\"*\"\n],\n\n            \n\"sequence\"\n:\n \n[\n\"remove_trailing_spaces\"\n],\n\n            \n\"action\"\n:\n \n\"mark\"\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Replace Plugins\n\ue157\n\n\nThere are times when simple regular expression replacements are not enough to get the job done.  Since RegReplace uses Python's re regular expression engine, we can use Python code to intercept the replacement and carry out more complex tasks via a plugin.  Because the plugins rely on Python's re, this will only apply to regular expression searches (not literal searches).\n\n\nIn this example we're going to search for dates in the YYYYMMDD format, and increment them by one day.\n\n\nBelow is the regular expression rule. Notice how we have defined a plugin to carry out replacement.  Plugins are defined as if importing a Python module.  In this example, we are loading it from the \nUser\n package. You do not need an \n__init__.py\n file in \nrr_modules\n folder \u2014 and it's use is discouraged: Sublime shouldn't bother loading these files since RegReplace will load them when needed.\n\n\n\"date_up\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"find\"\n:\n \n\"(?P<year>\\\\d{4})(?P<month>\\\\d{2})(?P<day>\\\\d{2})\"\n,\n\n    \n\"plugin\"\n:\n \n\"User.rr_modules.date_up\"\n\n    \n// \"args\": {\"some_plugin_arguments\": \"if_desired\"}  <== optional plugin arguments\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we can define the command that will utilize the regex rule:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\"caption\"\n:\n \n\"Replace: Date Up\"\n,\n\n        \n\"command\"\n:\n \n\"reg_replace\"\n,\n\n        \n\"args\"\n:\n \n{\n\"replacements\"\n:\n \n[\n\"date_up\"\n],\n \n\"find_only\"\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we provide the plugin.  RegReplace will load the plugin and look for a function called \nreplace\n.  \nreplace\n takes a python re match object, and any arguments you want to feed it.  Arguments are defined in the regular expression rule as shown above.\n\n\nSHORT_MONTH\n \n=\n \n30\n\n\nLONG_MONTH\n \n=\n \n31\n\n\nFEB_MONTH\n \n=\n \n28\n\n\nFEB_LEAP_MONTH\n \n=\n \n29\n\n\n\nJAN\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nFEB\n \n=\n \n2\n\n\nMAR\n \n=\n \n3\n\n\nAPR\n \n=\n \n4\n\n\nMAY\n \n=\n \n5\n\n\nJUN\n \n=\n \n6\n\n\nJUL\n \n=\n \n7\n\n\nAUG\n \n=\n \n8\n\n\nSEP\n \n=\n \n9\n\n\nOCT\n \n=\n \n10\n\n\nNOV\n \n=\n \n11\n\n\nDEC\n \n=\n \n12\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nis_leap_year\n(\nyear\n):\n\n    \nreturn\n \n((\nyear\n \n%\n \n4\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n \nand\n \n(\nyear\n \n%\n \n100\n \n!=\n \n0\n))\n \nor\n \n(\nyear\n \n%\n \n400\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \ndays_in_months\n(\nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n):\n\n    \ndays\n \n=\n \nLONG_MONTH\n\n    \nif\n \nmonth\n \n==\n \nFEB\n:\n\n        \ndays\n \n=\n \nFEB_LEAP_MONTH\n \nif\n \nis_leap_year\n(\nyear\n)\n \nelse\n \nFEB_MONTH\n\n    \nelif\n \nmonth\n \nin\n \n[\nSEP\n,\n \nAPR\n,\n \nJUN\n,\n \nNOV\n]:\n\n        \ndays\n \n=\n \nSHORT_MONTH\n\n    \nreturn\n \ndays\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nincrement_by_day\n(\nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n):\n\n    \nmdays\n \n=\n \ndays_in_months\n(\nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nday\n \n==\n \nmdays\n:\n\n        \nday\n \n=\n \n1\n\n        \nif\n \nmonth\n \n==\n \nDEC\n:\n\n            \nmonth\n \n=\n \nJAN\n\n            \nyear\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n        \nelse\n:\n\n            \nmonth\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n    \nelse\n:\n\n        \nday\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nreplace\n(\nm\n):\n\n    \ng\n \n=\n \nm\n.\ngroupdict\n()\n\n    \nyear\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\n\"year\"\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n\"0\"\n))\n\n    \nmonth\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\n\"month\"\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n\"0\"\n))\n\n    \nday\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\n\"day\"\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n\"0\"\n))\n\n\n    \nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n \n=\n \nincrement_by_day\n(\nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n)\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \n\"\n%04d%02d%02d\n\"\n \n%\n \n(\nyear\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nday\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some text to test the example on:\n\n\n# Test 1: 20140228\n# Test 2: 20141231\n# Test 3: 20140101\n\n\n\n\nRegReplace ships with a simple example you can test with (\n/Packages/RegReplace/rr_modules/example.py\n).

But if you prefer the\n\nmore advanced \nregex\n regular expression module, you can enable it with the\n\nfollowing setting:\n\n\n    \n// Use the regex module for regular expression.\n\n    \n// https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex\n\n    \n\"use_regex_module\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select whether to use Version 0 or Version 1 of the regex module, simply change the following setting:\n\n\n    \n// When \"use_regex_module\" is enabled, select which version of the regex module to use (0 or 1).\n\n    \n// See documentation to understand the differences: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex.\n\n    \n\"regex_module_version\"\n:\n \n0\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Back References\n\ue157\n\n\nRegReplace uses a special wrapper around Python's re library called backrefs.  Backrefs was written specifically for RegReplace and adds various additional backrefs that are known to some regular expression engines, but not to Python's re.  Backrefs adds: \n\\p\n, \n\\P\n, \n\\u\n, \n\\U\n, \n\\l\n, \n\\L\n, \n\\Q\n or \n\\E\n (though \n\\u\n and \n\\U\n are replaced with \n\\c\n and \n\\C\n).  It even adds some of the Posix style classes such as \n[:ascii:]\n etc.\n\n\nBackrefs also works with the regex module, but it enables a smaller portion of back references as the regex module implements a few of the back references already (in one form or the other).  For instance, there was no need to add Unicode properties as it was already available. And since you can already use Unicode and/or Posix properties for uppercase and lowercase character classes in search patterns, and regex already reserves \n\\L\n, it wasn't worth the extra work to try and add equivalents for \n\\c\n, \n\\C\n, 'l' and \n\\L\n to the search back references.\n\n\nYou can enable extended back references in the settings file:\n\n\n    \n// Use extended back references\n\n    \n\"extended_back_references\"\n:\n \ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen enabled, you can apply the back references to your search and/or replace patterns as you would other back references:\n\n\n    \n\"test_case\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"find\"\n:\n \n\"([a-z])(?P<somegroup>[a-z]*)((?:_[a-z]+)+)\"\n,\n\n        \n\"replace\"\n:\n \n\"\\\\c\\\\1\\\\L\\\\g<somegroup>\\\\E\\\\C\\\\g<3>\\\\E\"\n,\n\n        \n\"greedy\"\n:\n \ntrue\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about the backrefs' features in the \nBackrefs' documentation\n.\n\n\nGetting the Latest Backrefs\n\ue157\n\n\nIt is not always clear when Package Control updates dependencies.  So to force dependency updates, you can run Package Control's \nSatisfy Dependencies\n command which will update to the latest release.\n\n\nUsing Backrefs in RegReplace Plugins\n\ue157\n\n\nYou can import backrefs into a RegReplace plugin:\n\n\nfrom\n \nbackrefs\n \nas\n \nbre\n\n\n\n\n\nOr use bregex for the regex module with backrefs:\n\n\nfrom\n \nbackrefs\n \nas\n \nbregex\n\n\n\n\n\nBackrefs does provide a wrapper for all of re's normal functions such as \nmatch\n, \nsub\n, etc., but it's recommended to pre-compile your search patterns \nand\n your replace patterns for optimal performance \u2014 especially if you plan on reusing the same pattern multiple times.  Since re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls, you'll be spared from some performance hit, but backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.\n\n\nTo use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with \ncompile_search\n.  If you want to take advantage of replace backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice that the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.\n\n\npattern\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\ncompile_search\n(\nr\n'somepattern'\n,\n \nflags\n)\n\n\nreplace\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\ncompile_replace\n(\npattern\n,\n \nr\n'\\1 some replace pattern'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you can use the complied search pattern and replace:\n\n\ntext\n \n=\n \npattern\n.\nsub\n(\nreplace\n,\n \nr\n'sometext'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 or:\n\n\nm\n \n=\n \npattern\n.\nmatch\n(\nr\n'sometext'\n)\n\n\nif\n \nm\n:\n\n    \ntext\n \n=\n \nreplace\n(\nm\n)\n  \n# similar to m.expand(template)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just as you would in re; the names are the same.

            "text": "Regular Expression Engine  Remember that the regular expression engine that is used is Python's  Re , not Sublime's internal regular expression engine.  If enabling  extended_back_references , additional syntax (and some changes to existing syntax) is added which is covered in the  backrefs documentation .  To enable such features as case insensitivity or dotall, see  Re's documentation . If you've enabled the use of the  Regex  library, see  Regex's documentation .  Please note in the documentation the slight syntax differences in each regular expression library. Regex and Backrefs (with Regex or Re) handles things like  r '\\u0057'  in a replace template and converts it to Unicode, while Re will not and requires something like  \" \\u0057 \"  to represent Unicode (note that one is using Python raw strings and the other is not).  What this means in respect to RegReplace is that for Re you may have to use actual Unicode characters or represent Unicode in the JSON settings file differently; for Regex, you can use  \"\\\\u0057\" , and in Re you will have to use  \"\\u0057\"  (JSON's notation for a literal Unicode character). There is one exception with Regex though: \"format\" replace (without Backrefs) will not handle  \"\\\\u0057\" , and it will not handle  \"\\\\n\" , but will also need literal characters like  \"\\u0057\"  and  \"\\n\" .",

If  selection_inputs  is set to  True , selections will be inserted into your pattern via format string logic.  So to specify two implicit variables, the following format string logic can be used:  r'Some value {} some [\\w]+ {}' .  In this example, the first two selections will be inserted in  {} :  r'Some value selection0 some [\\w]+ selection1' .  To control which selection goes where, you can explicitly set the index:  r'Some value {1} some [\\w]+ {0}'  \u2192.  r'Some value selection1 some [\\w]+ selection0' . Or alternatively:  r'Some value {sel[1]} some [\\w]+ {sel[0]}'  ( sel  is the selection list).  By default, the selection is just inserted into the pattern raw.  This is fine for literal searches, but for regex this is bad if your selection is something like:  something(else) .  This example would be interpreted as adding a group containing  else . So if this is not intended, the text would need to be escaped. So a new conversion type has been added to the format template:  !e .  This new conversion type will insert the selection into the pattern after first escaping it.  So you could use it like so:  r'Some value {1!e} some [\\w]+ {0!e}' , and the selection inputs would be escaped.  For the sake of avoiding bad situations, RegReplace will limit the length of selections to the arbitrary value of 256, but you can configure this with the global setting  selection_input_max_size  in  reg_replace.sublime-settings . Also, the number of allowed inputs will be limited to 10, but this can be tweaked via the setting  selection_input_max_count .       // Limit size of selections for inputs. \n     \"selection_input_max_size\" :   256 , \n\n     // Limit number of selections for inputs. \n     \"selection_input_max_count\" :   10 ,   This should go without saying, but this is incompatible if you have the global option  selection_only  set which will search in selection content.  Though you can ignore it per command via the command parameter  no_selection .  So if you are constructing a chain that uses selection inputs, you can temporarily disable it with  no_selection .",

Users can even split their regular expressions on multiple lines and add comments which will be preserved the next time the rule is viewed.  While in the edit panel, you can press  Ctrl \uff0b S  on Windows/Linux (or  Cmd \uff0b S  on OSX) and the rule will be saved back to the settings file.  On saving, the regex is compiled to test if it's valid; if the test fails, a warning message is displayed and the saving operation is canceled.  To edit, insert, or delete rules, you can use the following command palette commands:   RegReplace: Edit Regular Expression Rule  RegReplace: Create New Regular Expression Rule  RegReplace: Delete Regular Expression Rule    You can also test the regular expression from the edit panel.  At the bottom of the panel, you should see the  test  variable which will allow you to configure a sequence to run from the panel.  Once configured, you can press  Ctrl \uff0b F  on Windows/Linux (or  Cmd \uff0b F  on OSX) to execute it.  Keep in mind that you can run the current rule sequenced together with others in the test configuration to test how it plays with other rules.   test  is not saved with the other settings, but is only good for the current session.  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  # test: Here you can setup a test command.

Depending on how the test command was configured, it may cause the panel to close, or you might accidentally close it by pressing  Esc  or running some other command.  When closed, the currently opened rule is not lost and can be brought back by running the command palette command  RegReplace: Show Edit Panel  (the command will only work if the panel has been opened at least once).

In this example we're going to search for dates in the YYYYMMDD format, and increment them by one day.  Below is the regular expression rule.

It even adds some of the Posix style classes such as  [:ascii:]  etc.  Backrefs also works with the regex module, but it enables a smaller portion of back references as the regex module implements a few of the back references already (in one form or the other).  For instance, there was no need to add Unicode properties as it was already available. And since you can already use Unicode and/or Posix properties for uppercase and lowercase character classes in search patterns, and regex already reserves  \\L , it wasn't worth the extra work to try and add equivalents for  \\c ,  \\C , 'l' and  \\L  to the search back references.

Since re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls, you'll be spared from some performance hit, but backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.  To use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with  compile_search .  If you want to take advantage of replace backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice that the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.  pattern   =   bre . compile_search ( r 'somepattern' ,   flags )  replace   =   bre . compile_replace ( pattern ,   r '\\1 some replace pattern' )   Then you can use the complied search pattern and replace:  text   =   pattern . sub ( replace ,   r 'sometext' )   \u2026 or:  m   =   pattern . match ( r 'sometext' )  if   m : \n     text   =   replace ( m )    # similar to m.expand(template)   To use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just as you would in re; the names are the same.  Methods like  sub  and  subn  will compile the replace pattern on the fly if given a string.  for   m   in   bre . finditer ( r 'somepattern' ,   'some text' ,   bre . UNICODE   |   bre . DOTALL ): \n     # do something   If you want to replace without compiling, you can use the  expand  method.  m   =   bre . match ( r 'sometext' )  if   m : \n     text   =   bre . expand ( m ,   r 'replace pattern' )",
